I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
#Hercules# and his gold
#Achilles# and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna #pick#?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some #powerhero#
Some fairytale bliss
Just something #you# can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, #boo#-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been #imagining# books of old
The #reasons# and the myths
The testaments they #test#
The #home# and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna #dream#?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can #accept#

I want something just like this
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, 
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, 

Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody #you# can kiss
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
